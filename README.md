# Delhi Air Quality Index Exploratiory Data Analysis in R

## Goal of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to understand the basic functionalities of R language. This is not meant to be a proper analysis of the data, but rather try out different commands in R to get a basic understanding of how it can be used to clean, process and visualize data using R.

## About Dataset
This dataset contains air quality data from the national capital of Delhi, India. It includes information on air pollution levels, including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) levels, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (O3), and other pollutants. The data was collected from monitoring stations located in various areas of Delhi between November 25, 2020, and January 24, 2023. This dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and policymakers to better understand air quality in Delhi and its impacts on public health.
